# OpenSAMP

OpenSAMP is an open-source application of spectrum availability, monitoring, and prediction which gathers 2G cellular network spectrum data for each mobile device running on it.
This application has been developed to gather required preliminary data for my M.Sc. thesis entitled "Context-aware Crowdsensing-based Spectrum Monitoring Service".
